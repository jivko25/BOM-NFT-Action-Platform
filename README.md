## ü§î How to use

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

See the demo of the project: https://bom-nft-auction-platform-fq3ndl40l-jivko25.vercel.app/

## üòè Some tips

- Use the colors from the `src/styles/colors.scss` file
- Use the custom `Link` component provided in the example
- Define pages in separate folders
- Use the classNames module when adding multiple (or single) classes
- Define components in the `/components` folder
- You shouldn't delete files from the boilerplate. You can only delete the Example component or build on top of it.

## üí° The idea

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).

## The link component

Next.js has [a custom Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link).
The example folder provides adapters for usage with MUI.
More information [in the documentation](https://mui.com/guides/routing/#next-js).

## What's next?

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

You now have a working example project.
You can head back to the documentation, continuing browsing it from the [templates](https://mui.com/getting-started/templates/) section.
